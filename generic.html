										<h2>Dissertation:</h2>
									</header>
									<p id = "right">My dissertation is titled, “Perceptions of and Approaches to Social Support Exchange
										while on Probation.” In this project, I use qualitative methodology to explore how social support
										exchange operates for individuals on probation in the St. Louis metropolitan region. It is well
										documented that romantic partners can have an immense impact on system impacted persons’
										desistance. At the same time, scholars document that the social and financial challenges of
										community supervision often cause system-impacted persons to rely on their families for
										assistance. However, far less is known about the processes that underlie relationship building and
										social support exchange for people under community supervision. In this dissertation, I seek to
										broaden existing literature by exploring how people under community supervision access support
										from and exchange support with many different people in their lives. Unique to this work, I
										examine how friends and acquaintances and how the financial challenges of community
										supervision play a role in social support exchange. <br>
										<br>
										While existing research in this area primarily uncovers the potential positive or negative
										influences that relationships may exert on criminal behavior, my research uncovers the nuance
										associated with probation compliance and how people on probation manage many different
										competing interests in an attempt to comply. Broadly, my findings demonstrate how the terms of
										probation, aimed at preventing individuals from engaging in future criminal behavior, may
										simultaneously disrupt long-standing, supportive relationships; prevent individuals from seeking
										out potentially prosocial relationships; and further tether individuals to the criminal legal system.
										Participants in this study reported the conditions of their probation were contradictory in that
										probation encouraged them to seek out prosocial opportunities, while preventing them from
										building or maintaining relationships. In certain cases, probation attempted to prevent contact
										between spouses and partners who had criminal convictions. Conditions of compliance (e.g.,
										treatment) also prevented individuals from building relationships with potentially supportive
										friends and acquaintances. A central concern participants reported were probation violations due
										to associating with others on probation. At times, participants discussed that they risked these
										probation violations of “association” to gain access to instrumental resources or maintained
										emotionally destructive relationships with family members to satisfy housing requirements
										associated with probation.</p>

										<h2>Monetary Sanctions:</h2>
									</header>
									<p id ="right">The bulk of my research explores the context and consequences of monetary sanctions, or
										legal-financial obligations (LFOs), which are the fines, fees, restitution, and surcharges imposed
										on individuals who come into contact with the criminal legal system. The following are some
										examples of my published work on monetary sanctions. In collaboration with Drs. Beth Huebner,
										Breanne Pleggenkuhle, and Kim Kras, I analyzed interview data from a sample of persons under
										correctional supervision to show how monetary sanctions can vary by offense type. In our article,
										<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/1745-9125.12294">The Price of a Sex Offense Conviction: A Comparative Analysis of the Costs of Community Supervision</a>
										 published in Criminology, we demonstrate how monetary sanctions levied against
										individuals convicted of sexual offenses can hide and extend carceral control for marginalized
										groups. In a lead-author paper, <a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/fsr/article-abstract/34/2-3/147/120293/Monetary-Sanctions-Assessed-for-Sexual-Offense?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Monetary Sanctions Assessed for Sexual Offense Convictions: Avenues for Policy Reform</a>
										 published in Federal Sentencing Reporter, Dr. Beth Huebner and I
										extend this work by documenting the unique costs associated with sexual offense convictions in
										Missouri and making policy recommendations to ameliorate potential harms of these costs.
										Relatedly, Dr. Beth Huebner and I documented the legal structure of municipal courts in the St.
										Louis region post-Ferguson and published our article, <a href= "https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/8/1/108">Reinforcing the Web of Municipal Courts: Evidence and Implications Post-Ferguson</a>
										 in RSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences. We contend that the fragmented, parochial nature of municipal
										courts in the area combined with lack of state oversight allows racialized financial predation to
										continue in the wake of Ferguson. My other ongoing work regarding monetary sanctions centers
										around how monetary sanctions impact relationships and influence perceptions of self and
										identity. My colleagues and I are also developing papers that address juvenile fines and fees,
										how women perceive monetary sanctions, and how court actors utilize parenthood and gender to
										assess monetary sanctions, and if and how state legislation effects the imposition of monetary
										sanctions.</p>

										<h2>Jail Length of Stay:</h2>
									</header>
									<p id ="right">In cooperation with scholars from the University of Louisville and UMSL, I am also
										writing papers that stem from my work as a research assistant on a study titled, “Understanding
										the Characteristics of Individuals Admitted to Jails and Their Lengths of Stay: A Multi-Site
										Analysis” funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts (Beth Huebner, Co-PI). My colleagues and I are
										conducting quantitative analyses which address the characteristics predict readmission to jail and
										length of stay in jail. You can find preliminary findings from our study <a href="https://datacollaborativeforjustice.org/work/jail/understanding-trends-in-jail-population-in-st-louis-county-missouri-2010-2019/">here</a>.</p>
